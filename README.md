Scikit-style PyTorch-autodiff multiparameter persistent homology python library. 
This library aims to provide easy to use and performant strategies for applied multiparameter topology.
<br> Meant to be integrated in [the Gudhi library](https://gudhi.inria.fr/).

## Multiparameter Persistence
This library allows to compute several representation from "geometrical datasets", e.g., point clouds, images, graphs, that have multiple scales. A well known example is is the following one. 
<br>
Pick a point cloud that has diffuse noise, or on which the sampling measure has some interesting properties, e.g., in the following example the measure has three modes.
<br>
Now define a two parameter grid (filtration) of topological spaces (on the left) from a point cloud $P$ on which we will compute the persistence of some topological structures (homological cycles).
This filtration $X$, indexed over a radius parameter $r$ and a codensity parameter $s$ is defined as follows

$$ X_{r,s} = \bigcup_{x \in P, \, \mathrm{density}(x) \ge s} B(x,r) = \lbrace x\in \mathbb R^2 \mid \exists p \in P, \, \mathrm{density}(p) \ge s \text{ and } d(x,p) \le r \rbrace$$

The green shape on the left represent the lifetime of the biggest annulus. On the right, each cycle appearing on the left gets a colored shape (the color is only a label) and the shape of this colored shape represents the lifetime of this cycle.
<br>
In our case, the big green shape on the left corresponds to the largest green shape appearing on the right, recovering the structure of the annulus here.

The **magic** part is that we never had to choose any parameter to remove the noise in this construction, but the annulus still naturally appears!
<br>A more strinking example is the following one.
Using the same constructions, we can identify topological structure, and their size, in a parameter free approach, even though the majority of the sampling measure's mass is noise.
<br> In this example, the lifetime shape associated to each cycle can be identified from 
 - Their radius : the smaller cycle will naturally live more this shape will appear on the "left" (smaller radius)
 - Their concentration : Cycles having more concentration will appear lower than others (smaller co-density)

Notice that this construction is also very stable w.r.t. the noise. The more noise is added the smaller the "rainbow strip" is, and the more the "large shape" are visible.

We also provide several other descriptors, as well as associated Machine Learning technics and pipelines. In the following example from the same dataset, the *Hilbert decomposition signed measure*, the *Euler decomposition signed measure* and the *rank decomposition signed measure*.

## Quick start


This library is available [on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/multipers/) for Linux and macOS, via
```sh
pip install multipers
```
We recommend Windows user to use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/). 
<br>
A documentation and building instructions are available [here](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/David.Loiseaux/doc/multipers/index.html).

## Features, and linked projects
This library features a bunch of different functions and helpers. See below for a non-exhaustive list.
<br>Filled box refers to implemented or interfaced code.
 - [x] [[Multiparameter Module Approximation]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02026) provides the multiparameter simplicial structure, as well as technics for approximating modules, via interval-decomposable modules. It is also very useful for visualization.

Implemented decompositions : Euler surfaces, Hilbert function, rank invariant (i.e. rectangles). It also provides representation technics for Machine Learning, i.e., Sliced Wasserstein kernels, and Vectorizations.
 - [x] [[A Framework for Fast and Stable Representations of Multiparameter Persistent Homology Decompositions, NeurIPS2023]](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/702b67152ec4435795f681865b67999c-Abstract-Conference.html) Provides a vectorization framework for interval decomposable modules, for Machine Learning. Currently implemented as an extension of MMA.
