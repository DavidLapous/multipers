# Multipersistence Modules Approximation (MMA)

## Description
This repository is a python library, with a `C++` backend, for multipersistence modules approximation. 
It provides a set of functions to compute an approximation of any multiparameter persistence module (from 1-critical filtrations if using python), aswell as some representations, e.g., Fibered Barcode, Multiparameter Persistence Images, Multiparameter Persistence Landscapes, etc.

This library is also available as a submodule of [multipers-signed-measure](https://github.com/DavidLapous/multipers-signed-measure).

## Installation, compilation
### Dependencies
A minimal environment with all dependencies can be obtained from scratch, with the following conda environment.

```bash
conda create -n python310
conda activate python310
conda install python=3.10 numpy matplotlib gudhi scikit-learn cython sympy tqdm cycler typing shapely -c conda-forge
pip install filtration-domination
```
 - Our multiparameter simplextrees are based on [Gudhi](https://gudhi.inria.fr)'s simplextrees.
 - [filtration_domination](https://github.com/aj-alonso/filtration_domination/) is needed for 2-parameter edge collapses.




### Installation
#### Using pip
Clone (or download) this repository and compile-install this library using the following commands in a terminal in the `src` folder

>	pip install --user .

#### Or manually :
Similarly, in the `src` folder, the following command will compile the python code.

> 	python setup.py build_ext	<br>

You should end up with a file `mma.cpython-*.so` (where `*` depends on your setup) in a `build` folder. This file can be directly imported to python.

## Usage
Import the compiled library and Gudhi in Python:
```python
import mma
import gudhi as gd
```
For an introduction, follow the tutorial notebook `How to use`. The notebook `examples_of_approximations` shows a few more examples. You can also find a few notebook relying on `MMA` in the [multipers-signed-measure](https://github.com/DavidLapous/multipers-signed-measure) fork.
