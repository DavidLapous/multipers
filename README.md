# Multipers
Scikit-style multiparameter persistent homology python library. 
This librairy aims to provide easy to use and performant strategies for applied multiparameter topology.
<br> Meant to be integrated in [the Gudhi library](https://gudhi.inria.fr/).

## Installation
### Dependencies
Using conda
```sh
conda create -n python311
conda activate python311
conda install python=3.11 cxx-compiler boost tbb tbb-devel numpy matplotlib gudhi scikit-learn cython sympy tqdm cycler typing shapely numba -c conda-forge
pip install filtration-domination pykeops
```

### Installation
In a terminal, in the root folder
```sh
pip install .
```
It has been tested with python 3.11 on Linux (gcc12) and Macos (clang14-clang16). 
If the build fails (on macos) see a fix at the end of the readme. 
Don't hesitate to fill an issue if this doesn't work out of the box; it can help future users ;-).

## How to use
### Tutorial notebooks
We provide a few notebooks, which explains, in different scenarios, how to use our library. <br>
**Take a look at them !** They are in the tutorial folder.<br>
If something is not clear, or you have trouble using a function, don't hesitate to fill an issue; I'll try to update this.

Implemented decompositions : Euler surfaces, Hilbert function, rank invariant (i.e. rectangles).

## For mac users 
Due to the clang compiler, one may have to disable a compilator optimization to compile `multipers`: in the `setup.py` file, add the 
```bash
-fno-aligned-new
```
line in the `extra_compile_args` list. You should have should end up with something like the following.
```python
extensions = [Extension(f"multipers.{module}",
	sources=[f"multipers/{module}.pyx"],
	language='c++',
	extra_compile_args=[
		"-Ofast",
		"-std=c++20",
		"-fno-aligned-new",
		'-ltbb',
		"-Wall",
	],
	extra_link_args=['-ltbb'],
	define_macros=[("NPY_NO_DEPRECATED_API", "NPY_1_7_API_VERSION")],
) for module in cython_modules]
```
#### Alternatives
One may try to use the `clang` compiler provided by conda or brew. If you have a simpler alternative, please let me know ;)
